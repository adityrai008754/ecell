We were both in different colleges.  One fine day, we met at my college fest through a common friend. Since then we started spending so much time together. Lunching and dining together, exchanging text messages everyday, talking about our days. Our favourite song was Love story by Taylor Swift. He always played that song in his car. But we were Just Friends, like really, Just Friends. And just like that we stopped talking, moved on with our lifes I guess. Ssthit just remained a sweet memory.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> </p>

He was from a different college, so we talked on WhatsApp a lot, but met rarely. In fact, we met for the first time almost 2 years after knowing one another. Over the years, we always stayed in touch and were each other's " someone special" but things never really kicked off properly as we were always in different cities, working on our careers and in different phases of life.  Yomesh was very particular to ask me out only when he was absolutely certain, and I had given up hopes on us. One day suddenly, after 6 years of being friends, Yomesh messaged me " Don't you think it's high time we started dating ?" I was surprised and couldn't believe this was finally happening, so it took me  6 months to say yes, and we went on our first "date" a year after dating one another over messages and phone calls.<i class="fas fa-quote-right"></i> </p>
